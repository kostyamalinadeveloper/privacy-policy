# AMBER – Privacy Policy  
_Last updated: 21 July 2025_

Raspberry Games (“we”, “our”, “us”) publishes the mobile game **AMBER** (version 3.9) for Android / Fire OS devices.  
This policy explains **what data we collect, why we collect it, and whether it is shared with third parties**.

## 1. Data We Collect

| Category | Examples | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Identifiers** | Advertising ID (AAID / Fire OS Advertising ID) | Ad personalisation, frequency capping, fraud prevention |
| **Device data** | Device model, OS version, language, country (by IP) | Analytics, content localisation |
| **Crash logs** | Stack traces, error codes | App stability and debugging |
| **Aggregated usage stats** | Session length, menu clicks, level progress | Game-design improvements (non-personalised) |

> **We do not request or store** name, e-mail, phone number, precise location, photos, payment info, or any sensitive personal data.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

1. **Advertising** – AMBER integrates the **Appodeal** SDK. The SDK uses the Advertising ID to show relevant ads and limit repetition.  
2. **Analytics** – Anonymous events help us understand game balance and performance.  
3. **Diagnostics** – Crashlytics reports let us fix bugs faster.

| **Amazon Appstore** | Store compliance checks | <https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468496> |

Only the data listed in section 1 is transmitted, over secure (HTTPS) channels. We never send personal identifiers like name or e-mail.

## 4. Storage & Security

* Data resides on partner servers (Appodeal, Google Firebase) only as long as needed for the purposes in section 2.  
* Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+) and industry-standard safeguards (OWASP Mobile) are applied.  
* Access is restricted to authorised staff on a need-to-know basis.

Alternatively, uninstalling the app stops any further data collection.
